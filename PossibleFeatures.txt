Potential Features:
=================================
Easiest:
    "3D" sprites (Based on angle between player and sprite, we select a different sprite)

    Some sort of lighting, could be baked in
    Proper Animation System
    
    Half Floors/Different Level Walls
    Vertical Doors (sprite zbuffer needed, as well as techniques for breaking up a pixel column) Could just do an animation with transparent textures
    Moveable Walls
        Vertical Movement (need a way to draw top/bottom wall face if moving vertically)
        Horiztonal Movement (counts on non-cubic wall and requires intersection checking like the door)
    
    Mirrors/Portals (Requires extending a raycast out the other end of the portal, then transforming the results back to create an effect array that go behind the wall)
                    (Requires some way to render the floor/ceiling & sprites onto the wall as well as texture. At this point we are basically doing the whole render pipeline from the portals pov)


Full Implements:
==========================
Adding a map with multiple levels
Adding in player height feature/making sure walls and sprites change with height too
Render the sides of the transparent walls??

Fixes:
=======================
Rendering floor/ceiling tiles outside the map range. Right now, memory weirdly
