Potential Features:
=================================
Easiest:
    Different Wall Textures for each face
    "3D" sprites (Based on angle between player and sprite, we select a different sprite)

    Some sort of lighting, could be baked in
    Proper Animation System
    
    Half Floors/Different Level Walls
    Transparent Walls (must know the wall is transparent or the current texture column is)
    Transparent Door (only challenge is incorportating a zbuffer for sprites with the transparent walls when they operate on two different systems)
    Moveable Walls
        Vertical Doors (sprite zbuffer needed, as well as techniques for breaking up a pixel column)
        Vertical Movement (need a way to draw top/bottom wall face if moving vertically)
        Horiztonal Movement (counts on non-cubic wall and requires intersection checking like the door)
    Mirrors/Portals (Requires extending a raycast out the other end of the portal, then transforming the results back to create an effect array that go behind the wall)
                    (Requires some way to render the floor/ceiling & sprites onto the wall as well as texture. At this point we are basically doing the whole render pipeline from the portals pov)


Full Implements:
==========================
Adding a map with multiple levels
Fixing the floor and ceiling for multiple levels
Adding in player height feature/making sure walls and sprites change with height too
