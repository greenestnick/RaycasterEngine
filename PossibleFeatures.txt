Potential Features:
Easiest:
    "3D" sprites (Based on angle between player and sprite, we select a different sprite)
    Taller Ceiling Height

    Different Wall Textures for each face
    Vertical Doors

Med:
    Some sort of lighting, could be baked in
    Transparent Walls (must know the wall is transparent or the current texture column is)

Hardest:
    Moveable Walls
        Vertical Movement (need a way to draw top/bottom wall face if moving vertically)
        Horiztonal Movement (counts on non-cubic wall and requires intersection checking like the door)
    Mirrors/Portals (Requires extending a raycast out the other end of the portal, then transforming the results back to create an effect array that go behind the wall)
                    (Requires some way to render the floor/ceiling & sprites onto the wall as well as texture. At this point we are basically doing the whole render pipeline from the portals pov)
