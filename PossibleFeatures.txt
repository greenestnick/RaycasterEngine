Potential Features:
=================================
Easiest:
    Different Wall Textures for each face
    "3D" sprites (Based on angle between player and sprite, we select a different sprite)

    Transparent Door (requires refactoring the render loop to interlace sprite and wall rendering based on a ZBuffer.)
    Some sort of lighting, could be baked in
    Proper Animation System
    
    Half Floors/Different Level Walls
    Transparent Walls (must know the wall is transparent or the current texture column is)
    Moveable Walls
        Vertical Doors (sprite zbuffer needed, as well as techniques for breaking up a pixel column)
        Vertical Movement (need a way to draw top/bottom wall face if moving vertically)
        Horiztonal Movement (counts on non-cubic wall and requires intersection checking like the door)
    Mirrors/Portals (Requires extending a raycast out the other end of the portal, then transforming the results back to create an effect array that go behind the wall)
                    (Requires some way to render the floor/ceiling & sprites onto the wall as well as texture. At this point we are basically doing the whole render pipeline from the portals pov)


Full Implements:
==========================
Adding a map with multiple levels
Adding in player height feature/making sure walls and sprites change with height too

Fixes:
=======================
Rendering floor/ceiling tiles outside the map range. Right now, memory is being access that shouldn't be
